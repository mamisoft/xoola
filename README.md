# xoola
Lightweight Remote Method Call Library

The initial aim of xoola was to create an interoperability bridge between java and c# language based applications. While this stayed as an internal project (and successfully completed), I decided to create an open source version for Java-Java communications using standard object serialization.

Although it is not a replacement for EJB or Spring remote invocation libraries, it can be easily used without any heavy server (just simple, standalone)
